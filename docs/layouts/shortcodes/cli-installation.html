<p>To install the CLI, use either <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (on Linux, macOS, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux)
or <a href="https://scoop.sh/">Scoop</a> (on Windows):</p>

<p>For manual installation, you can also <a href="https://github.com/platformsh/cli/releases/latest">download the latest binaries</a>.</p>
<p>A word about Macbooks with the M1 chip: It may be that you imported your brew
  formulae from a pre-M1 Mac, in which case your installation could be in the
  wrong place.</p>
<pre>
1. Make a list of your installed formulae: `brew list --formulae >~/Downloads/formulae.txt`
2. Unlink all of those formulae: `brew unlink $(brew list --formulae)`
3. Clear out your current Homebrew: `sudo rm -r /usr/local/Homebrew`
4. Reinstall Homebrew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
5. use Homebrew to reinstall all of your formulae: `brew install $(cat ~/Downloads/formulae.txt)`
</pre>
<p>You may have some formulae that Homebrew cannot find (for example, your
  formulae.txt file will have an entry for `platforms-cli`. Change that to read
  `platformsh/tap/platformsh-cli`, save the file and try Step #5 again. Repeat
  as necessary for other formulae that Homebrew cannot find.</p>
